          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <span class="paragraph">
            After dabbling with code in my spare time and talking incessantly to my friends about how much I loved it, I was introduced to the concept of a coding bootcamp.
            <br/><br/>
            I had previously done an online course with General Assembly and this then led me to choose GA when I decided to take the career change plunge and sign up for a course.
            <br/><br/>
            From the moment I was accepted onto the course I was learning everyday. Being challenged and rewarded in equal measure, the feeling of absorbing new skills and knowledge has been exhilarating and has pushed me to keep going.
            <br/><br/>
            In addition, the friendships and networks we have developed as part of the GA course have also been a big highlight.
          </span>

          <span class="paragraph">
            I had prior knowledge of HTML and CSS and so the biggest achievement for me was to reach a point where I understand and feel a level of confidence with JavaScript and JS frameworks such as React and Angular.
            <br/><br/>
            I will definitely work on personal projects using React but also plan to experiment with Ruby which we only touched on briefly during the course.
            <br/><br/>
            Another key learning point was how developers work as a team and the level of communication and planning required to make a group project a success. I will take this experience with me into any team that I join in the future.

            <p class="description">I designed a memory game with flashing tiles for my first project using jQuery, HTML & CSS. Using the design fundamentals we had been taught I created a wireframe and wrote pseudocode before coding.
