        <p>Hello!</p>
        <br/>
        <p>After dabbling with code in my spare time and talking incessantly to my friends about how much I loved it, I was introduced to the concept of a coding bootcamp. I had previously done an online course with General Assembly and this then led me to choose GA when I decided to take the career change plunge and sign up for a course.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>From the moment I was accepted onto the course I was learning everyday. Being challenged and rewarded in equal measure, the feeling of absorbing new skills and knowledge has been exhilarating and has pushed me to keep going. In addition, the friendships and networks we have developed as part of the GA course have also been a big highlight.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>I had prior knowledge of HTML and CSS and so the biggest achievement for me was to reach a point where I understand and feel a level of confidence with JavaScript and JS frameworks such as React and Angular.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>I will definitely work on personal projects using React but also plan to experiment with Ruby which we only touched on briefly during the course.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Another key learning point was how developers work as a team and the level of communication and planning required to make a group project a success. I will take this experience with me into any team that I join in the future.</p>
