        <p>Hello!</p>
        <br/>
        <p>In 2017 I made the decision to change. I wanted to become a Web Developer.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Initially, my passion for visual culture led me to pursue a career in the Arts sector; however, my fascination with creative practices and communication has since directed me towards programming.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>It wasn't a total surprise. One of my favourite classes at school was Information Technology and I loved playing around with database software and playing games. I also had a great time experimenting with HTML to create my own websites.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>From around 2015 I was feeling increasingly frustrated with various aspects of my career and so I took a <i>Learn to Code in A Day</i> course run by <a href="https://decoded.com/en-gb/">Decoded</a>. I had so much fun on this course and could not remember the last time I felt so excited and passionate about a subject. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Following this, a friend told me about coding bootcamps. This was the lightbulb moment for me. But, before taking the jump, I decided to do an online course with <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> to double check that web development was definately what I wanted to do. It was 8 weeks of remote learning about web design, HTML and CSS ( using a chromebook!! ). I loved it.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>By January 2017 I knew I wanted to take the leap. And so I did. I turned 30, quit my job and became a student once more. I enrolled in the <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive"> General Assembly London Web Development Immersive</a>. And from September to December 2017 I did nothing but code.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>During the course we covered a whole host of concepts, languages, libraries, frameworks and packages; including but not limited to: HTML5 , CSS3/SCSS,
        JavaScript, jQuery, JSON, React, AngularJS, Express, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Mocha, Chai, AJAX, XML, Git, Heroku, Yarn, npm, Bower, Gulp, Webpack, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL and ActiveRecord.</p>
        <br/>
        <p> Which leads me to now. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>I am really looking forward to seeing where the code will take me next.</p>
