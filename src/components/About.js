        <p>In 2017 I made the decision which I had been toying with for a while. I decided I wanted to become a web developer. For real.</p>
        <p>I remember at School I enjoyed playing around with Microsoft Access to make a database for a ficticious art gallery I hoped to own one day. I also remember experimenting with HTML to make my own fan-pages with Geocities.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to 2015 and I was feeling frustrated with elements of my job and so I did the Decoded, "Learn to code in a day" course which I loved. I had not felt so excited and passionate about a subject since I had done my undergraduate degree. However, I was not quite ready to break from my career path at that point. I wasn't sure I would be able to commit financially and mentally to a complete change in direction when I had worked so hard to make it in the job I was in.</p>
        <p>Later that year I was told about coding bootcamps. This was the beginning of the programming epiphany. Still nervous I decided to do an online course with General Assembly to double check that web development was really and truly what I wanted to do.</p>
        <p>It was 8 weeks of remote learning ( using a chromebook!! ) with a focus on HTML and CSS. I loved it.</p>
        <p>By January 2017 I knew I wanted to take the leap. And so I did. I turned 30, quit my job and became a student once more. I enrolled in the General Assembly London Web Development Immersive course and from September to December 2017 I studied harder than I can remember. </p>
        <p> Which leads me to now. And to you, dear reader.</p>

        <p>I love learning to code. I want to keep doing it. I look forward to seeing where this programming adventure will lead next.</p>
