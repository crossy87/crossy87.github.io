        <p>In 2017 I made the decision which I had been toying with for a while. I decided I wanted to become a web developer.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>One of my favourite classes at school was IT (Information Technology) and I loved playing around with database software and playing games. I also had a great time experimenting with HTML to design my own fan-pages with Geocities.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Fast forward to 2015 and I was feeling frustrated with various aspects of my career and so I took a 'Learn to Code in A Day' course run by Decoded. I had not felt so excited and passionate about a subject since I had done my undergraduate degree. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Later that year a friend told me about coding bootcamps. This was the beginning of the programming epiphany. Still nervous I decided to do an online course with General Assembly to double check that web development was really and truly what I wanted to do.</p>
        <p>It was 8 weeks of remote learning ( using a chromebook!! ) with a focus on HTML and CSS. I loved it.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>By January 2017 I knew I wanted to take the leap. And so I did. I turned 30, quit my job and became a student once more. I enrolled in the General Assembly London Web Development Immersive course and from September to December 2017 I studied harder than I can remember. </p>
        <br/>
        <p> Which leads me to now. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>I love learning to code.</p>
        <br/>
        <p> I look forward to seeing where the code will take me next.</p>
